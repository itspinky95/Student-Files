# Public API Requests Web Application

This web application retrieves and displays user profiles from a public API, allowing users to view employee details and toggle between light and dark modes. The project includes features like a search bar, a mode toggle button, and a modal for displaying additional user information.

## Project Overview

This web application was created to demonstrate the following functionality:

- Fetching user profiles from a public API (randomuser.me).
- Displaying user profiles in a gallery format with cards.
- Allowing users to search for employees by name.
- Enabling users to switch between light and dark modes with a mode toggle button.
- Providing a modal for detailed employee information.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: The application fetches 12 random user profiles from the API and displays them as cards in a gallery.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for employees by name using the search bar. The displayed profiles are filtered based on the search query.

- **Dark Mode**: The application supports both light and dark modes. Users can toggle between modes using the mode toggle button.

- **Modal Display**: Clicking on a user card opens a modal displaying additional information about the employee, including their profile picture, name, email, address, and birthday. Users can navigate between employees in the modal.
